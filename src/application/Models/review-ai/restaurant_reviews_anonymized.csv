have been listening. The food was brought out after waiting for 15 - 20 minutes and it was so spicy I could barely take the flavor of my paneer masala. Overall I was very

Rose Restaurant,"First time here, and it was a pretty great experience. The guy in the front taking orders was very helpful. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very transparent with his 
answers. We decided to get theTikka Pizza, Southern Curry Chicken Bowl, and the Spicy Chcicken Kabob. We also ended with the Mango Lassi, Gulab Jamun and the Ras Maiai. The 
Southern Curry Chicken bowl tasted great, but it came out a good 3-5 minutes before anything else so by the time we got the remaining food it was cold. The Tikka Pizza ________. 
The spicy chicken kabob was good, but I wish it came out warmer and it wasn't very spicy. I enjoyed the salad that came with it and the garlic naan bread was amazing. The dessert 
were unique. I can't say we were crazy about the Gulab Jamun but I did enjoy the Rad Maiai.

The atmosphere was open and inviting, and although not advertised (which isn't a bad thing always) they do have WiFi so as a student you can stop by for a quick lunch and do 
some studying as well.

Overall I was impressed. If you are looking for a quick food option that's different then traditional options this is a great place to consider!

Rose Restaurant,"The second location in Lubbock. Rose Restaurant is a fast casual Indian cuisine with self-service similar to the Chipotle concept. In fact, the bowl it uses is very similar to the Chipotle 
bowl. The dining area is spacious with modern open ceiling. There are two private toilet rooms, one for each gender. The ordering process is simple and straightforward. The 
menu selection is adequate, not overwhelming and easy to understand. The older lady that stationed at the front counter seems to be of Indian descent so it should hint at 
authentic Indian cuisine. However, I wasn't impressed with my southern curry entree. It's slightly better than the supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal. The southern 
curry misses the mark - it lacked flavors and depth. I had more enjoyable and better valued meals at Indian buffets I had visited. An example of Americanized Indian restaurant I 
like is Tarka Indian Kitchen - it's fast casual dining without skimping in taste. I have known many ethnic restaurants and many more mediocre ones - the latter often have very 
mediocre chef who wouldn't make it his or her own hometown.",1,0,4.407582938,1.571428571,15.16129032,15.07142857,14,211,16,40,0,0.839285714,0.822916667,6.642857143,0.677248677,1,1

"Gloria Restaurant
","knew i was in trouble when i walked in the restaurant and there was not the usual aroma of an indian restaurant.This is by far the worst Indian food i have ever had, I am not indian but i have traveled to cities with large Indian populations such as Vancouver BC, LA, and Houston TX. So i have a pretty good idea what the food should taste like. Without sounding downright hateful, this must be what Indian prison food tastes like: it was watery, under seasoned, and made with the cheapest of ingredients. It had no spice which is the hallmark of indian food.and when i asked for chutney to try to spice up the food so it would be somewhat fit to eat, the establishment said: we don't have any but how about a chopped jalapeno pepper?

I am sorry but the 4~ 5 star reviews are hoaxes. I will go as far as to say this: this was the worse food i have had to paid for in the last 10 years.",1,0,3.689119171,2.428571429,10.60869565,27.57142857,7,193,22,18,0,0.630434783,0.828571429,15.14285714,0.625,4,0
